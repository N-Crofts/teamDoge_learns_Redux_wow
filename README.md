1. Why did you choose this subject?
    >Redux seems like a very poweful framework that's used by many developers. There's a good chance we'll find ourselves at jobs that will require it, so it's best to get a handle on it now. Also, we had two day's worth of intro.

2. How were you first made aware of it?
    >Redux is one of those things you always hear paired with React. Also, we had an intro two days ago.

3. What problem does it solve?
    >Redux makes handling an excessive amount of components easier more manageable.

4. How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
    > Redux acts as container for state. Its data-flow is specific, moving top to bottom.

5. Why does one use it?
    >Usually when an application grows too large, requiring more and more components.

6. What are the alternatives?
    >React (or Angular) itself is the usual alternative to using Redux. If the app involved is small, requiring only a handful of components, then Redux is probably uneccessary.

7. What is it similar to, if anything?
    >Facebook's FLUX architecture.

8. What is the history of this technology?
    >Early stages were mapped out by React creator Dan Abramov while preparing for a conference. He later collaborated with Flux creator Andrew Clarke to develop Redux in 2015.

9. Who built it and why?
    >Dan Abramov and Andrew Clarke. Abramov remarks, "I was trying to make a proof of concept of Flux where I could change the logic. And it would let me time travel. And it would let me reapply the future actions on the code change."

10. Who is maintaining it?
    >Redux is open source. It looks like it's maintained by the Redux community of enthusiasts and their god emperor Dan Abramov.

11. What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
    >It seems, conceptually, very useful; however the extent of that usefulness won't fully be apreciated until we work on a very large project with Redux.

12. What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
    >Visualizing the data-flow and understanding why it's neccessary to contain similar functions in both actions and reducers.

14. What resources do you recommend for interested students?
    >There are some great YouTube tutorials out there that we were enjoying. We recommend just searching YT for 'Redux tutorial'.

15. What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
    >https://www.valentinog.com/blog/react-redux-tutorial-beginners/

16. What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?
    >1. What are the three principles of Redux?
    >2. What are the benfis of Redux?
    >3. Describe state architecture in Redux.
